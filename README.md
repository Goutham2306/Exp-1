# Exp-1 ATM & BANKING SYSTEM

# AIM:
To develop an ATM and Bank Management System that allows users to securely perform basic banking operations like deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and fund transfers.

# SRS (Procedure):

i) Usecase Diagram

ii)Class Diagram

iii)Activity Diagram

iv)Communication Diagram

v)Package Diagram

vi)Sequence Diagram
